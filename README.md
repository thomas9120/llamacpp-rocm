> **⚡ Ready to Run**: All releases include complete ROCm™ 7 runtime libraries - just download and go!

> **Linux (gfx1150/APU):** OOM despite free VRAM? Add `ttm.pages_limit=12582912` (48 GB) to the kernel cmdline (e.g. GRUB), run `update-grub`, then reboot. See [TheRock FAQ](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/blob/main/docs/faq.md#gfx1151-strix-halo-specific-questions) for more.

## 🧪 Quick Smoketest

To verify your download is working correctly:

1. **Download** the appropriate build for your GPU target from our [latest releases](https://github.com/aigdat/llamacpp-rocm/releases/latest)
2. **Extract** the archive to your preferred directory
3. **Test** with any GGUF model from Hugging Face:

```bash
llama-server -m YOUR_GGUF_MODEL_PATH -ngl 99
```

> **💡 Tip**: Use `-ngl 99` to offload all layers to GPU for maximum acceleration. The exact number of layers may vary by model, but 99 ensures all available layers are offloaded.

> **🍋 Lemonade Integration**: You can also test these builds directly with [**Lemonade**](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade) for a seamless AI application experience *(coming soon!)*

## 📋 Manual Build Instructions

For detailed manual build instructions, please see: **[docs/manual_instructions.md](docs/manual_instructions.md)**

## 💻 Local Build Script (Windows)

`scripts/Build-LlamaCppRocm.ps1` reproduces the CI pipeline locally on a Windows
machine — it downloads the latest TheRock ROCm 7 nightly, clones llama.cpp, builds
with HIP, and stages a self-contained folder next to the binaries. Defaults to
**gfx1151**; every stage is skippable for fast re-runs.

```powershell
# Default: gfx1151, latest ROCm + latest llama.cpp
.\scripts\Build-LlamaCppRocm.ps1

# Pin specific versions
.\scripts\Build-LlamaCppRocm.ps1 -GpuTarget gfx1151 -RocmVersion 7.13.0a20260318

# Fast iteration: re-run only configure/build/stage (ROCm + llama.cpp already present)
.\scripts\Build-LlamaCppRocm.ps1 -SkipDeps -SkipRocmDownload -SkipClone

# Fresh full rebuild
.\scripts\Build-LlamaCppRocm.ps1 -Clean
```

Output lands in `build-output\<GpuTarget>\` — smoketest from there:
```powershell
cd build-output\gfx1151
.\llama-server.exe -m <your-model.gguf> -ngl 99
```

> **⚠️ VS 2022 required:** Upstream pins to VS 2022 (MSVC 14.4x). VS 2026
> (MSVC 14.51) breaks the HIP build via a `<cmath>` constexpr collision
> ([llama.cpp#22570](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/22570)).
> The script warns if VS 2026 is detected.
